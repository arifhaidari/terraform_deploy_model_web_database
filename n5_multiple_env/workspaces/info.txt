Explanation of Environment Differentiation
This configuration uses Terraform workspaces to distinguish between environments (like production and staging). 
The local.environment_name variable dynamically captures the workspace name, allowing conditional configurations 
and unique resource naming. For example:

create_dns_zone is set to true only if the workspace is production, meaning DNS resources will only be created 
in production.
Resources like the S3 bucket prefix and database name are prefixed with the environment name 
(web-app-data-staging or web-app-data-production), ensuring unique identifiers across environments.
