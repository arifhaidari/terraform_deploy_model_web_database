## **Project Overview**

This repository was created as a part of a hands-on project to develop proficiency with **Terraform** for managing and deploying infrastructure on **AWS**. The project demonstrates infrastructure automation and orchestration practices, from provisioning AWS EC2 instances and EBS volumes to deploying a WordPress application on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts. A CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions further facilitates deployment automation and workflow optimization.

### **Detailed Folder Explanations**

1. **aws-data2**: Contains configurations to provision resources on AWS, such as EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and security groups.
2. **kubernetes**: Configures the Kubernetes provider and includes Helm charts for deploying MySQL and WordPress applications. This includes files for managing Kubernetes resources and testing connections using Helm.

3. **n1_start**: Basic Terraform setup to initialize the project and practice foundational commands.

4. **n2_route_rds**: Focuses on setting up AWS RDS and routing configurations, with supporting documentation and architecture diagrams.

5. **n3_tf_syntax**: Examples of Terraform syntax, including variable and output management, to refine understanding of Terraform's declarative syntax.

6. **n4_third_party_tools**: Integrates with tools like Consul, demonstrating multi-tool orchestration for monitoring, configuration, or service discovery.

7. **n5_multiple_env**: Demonstrates environment-specific configurations (e.g., staging, production) using Terraform workspaces.

8. **n6_bash_testing**: Contains bash and Go tests (using Terratest) for validating infrastructure code, improving reliability and reducing deployment errors.

9. **reports**: Stores various reports, including `commands.txt` and `reports.odt`, documenting commands and side notes that help track project progress and insights.

## **Deployment Details**

### **AWS Configuration**

- **Instances and Security**: Deployed EC2 instances with security groups defined in `aws-data2`, ensuring proper isolation and security measures.
- **EBS Storage**: Attached EBS volumes to instances to provide scalable storage.
- **Output Management**: Defined outputs to streamline resource information access.

### **Kubernetes with Helm**

- **MySQL and WordPress Deployment**: Used Helm charts for MySQL and WordPress in the `kubernetes/charts` directory to deploy applications on Kubernetes clusters.
- **Helm Provider**: Leveraged Terraform's Helm provider for efficient management and versioning of Kubernetes resources.

### **CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions**

- Automated deployment workflow configured in `.github/workflows` (to be added), allowing continuous integration and continuous deployment for Terraform changes.

## **Key Concepts & Technologies**

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: This project applies IaC practices to deploy, configure, and manage infrastructure, making it easier to track and reproduce changes.
- **AWS Provider**: Used to provision and manage resources like EC2, EBS, and RDS on AWS.
- **Kubernetes Provider and Helm**: Helm charts simplify application deployment on Kubernetes clusters by managing Kubernetes YAML templates and dependencies.
- **Workspaces for Multiple Environments**: Terraform workspaces enable seamless multi-environment support, such as staging and production.
- **Bash and Terratest**: Validates infrastructure configurations, ensuring deployments meet specified requirements.

## **Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites**:

   - Terraform installed (v0.14 or above recommended)
   - AWS credentials configured (access and secret keys)
   - Kubernetes cluster configured (e.g., with EKS or local Minikube)
   - Helm installed for managing Kubernetes applications

2. **Initialize and Deploy**:
   - Clone this repository
   - Navigate to the folder for the specific environment, e.g., `aws-data2`
   - Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory
   - Run `terraform plan` to review changes
   - Execute `terraform apply` to deploy resources to AWS or Kubernetes clusters

## **Future Enhancements**

- **Adding Monitoring**: Integrate monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana to track infrastructure metrics.
- **Improving CI/CD**: Extend GitHub Actions with linting and testing stages.
- **Automated Scaling**: Implement auto-scaling configurations for Kubernetes deployments.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Add architecture diagrams for better visualization of infrastructure.
