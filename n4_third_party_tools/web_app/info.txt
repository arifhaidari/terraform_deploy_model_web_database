This Terraform configuration:

Sets up an S3 backend with DynamoDB state locking.
Defines sensitive variables for database credentials.
Deploys two versions of a web application (production environment) using the same module, each with 
unique domain and configuration details, including an EC2 instance, S3 bucket prefix, DNS zone, and 
database configuration.


In the code, the web_app_module is a reusable Terraform module configured to deploy a web application. 
This module is sourced twice with different inputs to create two independent versions of the application, 
each with its own configurations (e.g., domain, bucket, database settings).

The module likely includes configurations for common resources such as:

S3 Bucket: For storing application data, specified by the bucket_prefix.
DNS Zone: Managed by Route 53, to handle the custom domain (domain) and DNS configurations, controlled by 
create_dns_zone.
EC2 Instance: For hosting the application, with an instance type (instance_type) and possibly other settings.
RDS Database: With configurable parameters for the database (db_name, db_user, db_pass), tailored to each 
app version.
The moduleâ€™s flexibility allows it to be used to create multiple instances of the same application in 
different configurations by simply adjusting the input variables for each instance.
